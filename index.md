I’ve compiled a list of essential Vim commands that I use every day. I have then given a few instructions on how to make Vim as great as it should be, because it’s painful without configuration.

## Essentials

### Cursor movement (Normal/Visual Mode)

- `h` `j` `k` `l` - Arrow keys
- `w` / `b` - Next/previous word
- `W` / `B` - Next/previous word (space separated)
- `e` / `ge` - Next/previous end of word
- `0` / `$` - Start/End of line
- `^` - First non-blank character of line (same as `0w`)

### Editing text

- `i` / `a` - Start insert mode at/after cursor
- `I` / `A` - Start insert mode at the beginning/end of the line
- `o` / `O` - Add blank line below/above current line
- `Esc` or `Ctrl+[` - Exit insert mode
- `d` - Delete
- `dd` - Delete line
- `c` - Delete, then start insert mode
- `cc` - Delete line, then start insert mode

### Operators

- Operators also work in Visual Mode
- `d` - Deletes from the cursor to the movement location
- `c` - Deletes from the cursor to the movement location, then starts insert mode
- `y` - Copy from the cursor to the movement location
- `>` - Indent one level
- `<` - Unindent one level
- You can also combine operators with motions. Ex: `d$` deletes from the cursor to the end of the line.

### Marking text (visual mode)

- `v` - Start visual mode
- `V` - Start linewise visual mode
- `Ctrl+v` - Start visual block mode
- `Esc` or `Ctrl+[` - Exit visual mode

### Clipboard

- `yy` - Yank (copy) a line
- `p` - Paste after cursor
- `P` - Paste before cursor
- `dd` - Delete (cut) a line
- `x` - Delete (cut) current character
- `X` - Delete (cut) previous character
- `d` / `c` - By default, these copy the deleted text

### Exiting

- `:w` - Write (save) the file, but don't quit
- `:wq` - Write (save) and quit
- `:q` - Quit (fails if anything has changed)
- `:q!` - Quit and throw away changes

### Search/Replace

- `/pattern` - Search for pattern
- `?pattern` - Search backward for pattern
- `n` - Repeat search in same direction
- `N` - Repeat search in opposite direction
- `:%s/old/new/g` - Replace all old with new throughout file ([gn](http://vimcasts.org/episodes/operating-on-search-matches-using-gn/) is better though)
- `:%s/old/new/gc` - Replace all old with new throughout file with confirmations

### General

- `u` - Undo
- `Ctrl+r` - Redo

## Advanced

### Cursor movement

- `Ctrl+d` - Move down half a page
- `Ctrl+u` - Move up half a page
- `}` - Go forward by paragraph (the next blank line)
- `{` - Go backward by paragraph (the next blank line)
- `gg` - Go to the top of the page
- `G` - Go the bottom of the page
- `: [num] [enter]` - Go to that line in the document
- `ctrl+e / ctrl+y` - Scroll down/up one line

### Character search

- `f [char]` - Move forward to the given char
- `F [char]` - Move backward to the given char
- `t [char]` - Move forward to before the given char
- `T [char]` - Move backward to before the given char
- `;` / `,` - Repeat search forwards/backwards

### Editing text

- `J` - Join line below to the current one
- `r [char]` - Replace a single character with the specified char (does not use Insert mode)

### Visual mode

- `O` - Move to other corner of block
- `o` - Move to other end of marked area

### File Tabs

- `:e filename` - Edit a file
- `:tabe` - Make a new tab
- `gt` - Go to the next tab
- `gT` - Go to the previous tab
- `:vsp` - Vertically split windows
- `ctrl+ws` - Split windows horizontally
- `ctrl+wv` - Split windows vertically
- `ctrl+ww` - Switch between windows
- `ctrl+wq` - Quit a window

### Marks

- Marks allow you to jump to designated points in your code.
- `m{a-z}` - Set mark {a-z} at cursor position
- A capital mark {A-Z} sets a global mark and will work between files
- `'{a-z}` - Move the cursor to the start of the line where the mark was set
- `''` - Go back to the previous jump location

### Text Objects

- Say you have `def (arg1, arg2, arg3)`, where your cursor is somewhere in the middle of the parenthesis.
- `di(` deletes everything between the parenthesis. That says "change everything inside the nearest parenthesis". Without text objects, you would need to do `T(dt)`.

### General

- `.` - Repeat last command
- `Ctrl+r + 0` in insert mode inserts the last yanked text (or in command mode)
- `gv` - reselect (select last selected block of text, from visual mode)
- `%` - jumps between matching `()` or `{}`

# Making VIM actually useful

Vim is quite unpleasant out of the box. It's an arcane experience:

- Autocomplete is missing
- System clipboard is not used
- Act of typing `:w` to save is cumbersome
- Mouse doesn't work
- Management of multiple files is tricky
- Integration with other plugins (like compiler warnings) is challenging
- Repeatedly indenting/unindenting multiple lines is challenging, though possible

It does have a significant strength though: your fingers can stay on the main keyboard keys to do most editing actions. This is faster and more ergonomic. I find that the toughest part about VIM is guiding people towards getting the benefits of VIM without the drawbacks. Here are some ideas on how to go about this.

## Switch caps lock and escape

- I highly recommend you switch the mapping of your caps lock and escape keys. You'll love it, promise! Switching the two keys is platform dependent.

## Visual Studio Code

- VSCode is the simplest way to give you a fantastic editor that also gives you the benefits of VIM. Just install [the VIM extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vscodevim.vim).
- I made a [few slight changes](https://gist.github.com/theicfire/dc3f7f8c9a19467643a58dff22eb00d9) which improved the experience for me.

## Configure native VIM

For all the given limitations, you'll need to find a solution. You can either solve the issues one by one, or you can use a reference .vimrc settings file that fix most of the issues out-of-the-box.

- [My .vimrc file](https://github.com/theicfire/dotfiles/blob/master/vim/.vimrc) could be a good starting point. Honestly, it's a bit old and not the best. I now use VSCode mainly so I haven't kept a great vimrc.

### Using the system clipboard

- `"+y` copy a selection to the system clipboard
- `"+p` paste from the system clipboard
- If this doesn't work, it’s probably because Vim was not built with the system clipboard option. To check, run `vim --version` and see if `+clipboard` exists. If it says `-clipboard`, you will not be able to copy from outside of Vim.
  - For Mac users, homebrew install Vim with the clipboard option. Install homebrew and then run `brew install vim`.
    - then move the old Vim binary: `$ mv /usr/bin/vim /usr/bin/vimold`
    - restart your terminal and you should see `vim --version` now with `+clipboard`

## Sublime Text

- Another option is to use Vintageous in Sublime Text (version 3). This gives you Vim mode inside Sublime. I suggest this (or a similar setup with the Atom editor) if you aren't a Vim master. Check out [Advanced Vim](advanced.html) if you are.
- Vintageous is great, but I suggest you change a few settings to make it better.

  - Clone [this repository](https://github.com/theicfire/Vintageous) to `~/.config/sublime-text-3/Packages/Vintageous`, or similar. Then check out the "custom" branch.
    - Alternatively, you can get a more updated Vintageous version by cloning [the official](https://github.com/guillermooo/Vintageous) repository and then copying over [this patch](https://github.com/theicfire/Vintageous/commit/19ff6311b01e3ae259b7eb8e3944687b42ba06ff).
  - Change the user settings (`User/Preferences.sublime-settings`) to include:
    - `"caret_style": "solid"`
    - This will make the cursor not blink, like in Vim.
    - Sublime Text might freeze when you do this. It’s a bug; just restart Sublime Text after changing the file.
  - `ctrl+r` in Vim means "redo". But there is a handy Ctrl + R shortcut in Sublime Text that gives an "outline" of a file. I remapped it to alt+r by putting this in the User keymap
    - `{ "keys": ["alt+r"], "command": "show_overlay", "args": {"overlay": "goto", "text": "@"} },`
  - [Add the ability to toggle Vintageous on and off](https://github.com/guillermooo/Vintageous/wiki/Toggling-Vintageous)
  - Mac users: you will not have the ability to hold down a navigation key (like holding j to go down). To fix this, run the commands specified here: [https://gist.github.com/kconragan/2510186](https://gist.github.com/kconragan/2510186)

- Now you should be able to restart sublime and have a great Vim environment! Sweet Dude.

## Other

I don’t personally use these yet, but I’ve heard other people do!

- `:qa` - Quit all open buffers
- `:wa` - Write all open buffers
- `:wqa` - Write and quit all open buffers
