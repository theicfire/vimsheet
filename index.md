#A Great Vim Cheat Sheet


Note: If you’re decent at Vim and want your mind blown, check out [Advanced Vim](advanced.html).

I’ve compiled a list of *essential* Vim commands that I use every day. I then give a few instructions on how to making Vim as great as it should be, because it’s painful without configuration.

##Cursor movement (Inside command/normal mode)

<img src="images/hjkl.png" alt="The four directions in Vim, keys h, j, k, and l."/>

* `w` - jump by start of words (punctuation considered words)
* `W` - jump by words (spaces separate words)
* `e` - jump to end of words (punctuation considered words)
* `E` - jump to end of words (no punctuation)
* `b` - jump backward by words (punctuation considered words)
* `B` - jump backward by words (no punctuation)
* `0` - (zero) start of line
* `^` - first non-blank character of line (same as 0w)
* `$` - end of line
* Advanced (in order of what I find useful)
    * `Ctrl+d` - move down half a page
    * `Ctrl+u` - move up half a page
    * `}` - go forward by paragraph (the next blank line)
    * `{` - go backward by paragraph (the next blank line)
    * `gg` - go to the top of the page
    * `G` - go the bottom of the page
    * `: [num] [enter]` - Go To that line in the document
    * Searching
        * `f [char]` - Move to the next char on the current line after the cursor
        * `F [char]` - Move to the next char on the current line before the cursor
        * `t [char]` - Move to before the next char on the current line after the cursor
        * `T [char]` - Move to before the next char on the current line before the cursor
        * All these commands can be followed by `;` (semicolon) to go to the next searched item, and `,` (comma) to go the the previous searched item

##Insert/Appending/Editing Text
* Results in insert mode
    * `i` - start insert mode at cursor
    * `I` - insert at the beginning of the line
    * `a` - append after the cursor
    * `A` - append at the end of the line
    * `o` - open (append) blank line below current line (no need to press return)
    * `O` - open blank line above current line
    * `cc` - change (replace) an entire line
    * `c  [movement command]` - change (replace) from the cursor to the move-to point.
    * ex. `ce` changes from the cursor to the end of the cursor word
* `Esc` or `Ctrl+[` - exit insert mode
* `r  [char]` - replace a single character with the specified char (does not use insert mode)
* `d` - delete
    * `d` - [movement command] deletes from the cursor to the move-to point.
    * ex. `de` deletes from the cursor to the end of the current word
* `dd` - delete the current line
* Advanced
    * `J` - join line below to the current one

##Marking text (visual mode)
* `v` - starts visual mode
    * From here you can move around as in normal mode (hjkl, etc.) and can then do a command (such as `y`, `d`, or `c`)
* `V` - starts linewise visual mode
* `Ctrl+v` - start visual block mode
* `Esc` or `Ctrl+[` - exit visual mode
* Advanced
    * `O` - move to Other corner of block
    * `o` - move to other end of marked area

##Visual commands
Type any of these while some text is selected to apply the action

* `y` - yank (copy) marked text
* `d` - delete marked text
* `c` - delete the marked text and go into insert mode (like c does above)

##Cut and Paste
* `yy` - yank (copy) a line
* `p` - put (paste) the clipboard after cursor
* `P` - put (paste) before cursor
* `dd` - delete (cut) a line
* `x` - delete (cut) current character
* `X` - delete previous character (like backspace)

##Exiting
* `:w` - write (save) the file, but don't exit
* `:wq` - write (save) and quit
* `:q` - quit (fails if anything has changed)
* `:q!` - quit and throw away changes

##Search/Replace
* `/pattern` - search for pattern
* `?pattern` - search backward for pattern
* `n` - repeat search in same direction
* `N` - repeat search in opposite direction
* `:%s/old/new/g` - replace all old with new throughout file ([gn](https://github.com/vinitkumar/white-paper) is better though)
* `:%s/old/new/gc` - replace all old with new throughout file with confirmations

##Working with multiple files - Tabs
* `:e filename` - Edit a file
* `:tabe` - Make a new tab
* `gt` - Go to the next tab
* `gT` - Go to the previous tab
* Advanced
    * `:vsp` - vertically split windows
    * `ctrl+ws` - Split windows horizontally
    * `ctrl+wv` - Split windows vertically
    * `ctrl+ww` - switch between windows
    * `ctrl+wq` - Quit a window

##Working with multiple files - Buffers
* `:enew` - edit a new, unnamed buffer
* `:ls` - list all open buffers
* `:bn` - go to the next buffer
* `:bp` - go to the previous buffer
* `:b[N]` - goto buffer numbered N
    * ex. `:b2` will bring buffer numbered 2 to your tab
* `:b filename-prefix` - goto buffer with the corresponding filename-prefix
* `Ctrl+^` - Toggle between current and last buffer
* `Ctrl+o` - Go to the previous buffer you were in
* `Ctrl+i` - Reverse the effect of `Ctrl+o`

##Marks
Marks allow you to jump to designated points in your code.

* `m{a-z}` - Set mark {a-z} at cursor position 
* A capital mark {A-Z} sets a global mark and will work between files
* `‘{a-z}` - move the cursor to the start of the line where the mark was set
* `‘’` - go back to the previous jump location

##General
* `u` - undo
* `Ctrl+r` - redo
* `.` - repeat last command

#Making Vim actually useful
Vim is quite unpleasant out of the box. For example, typeing `:w` for every file save is awkward and copying and pasting to the system clipboard does not work. But a few changes will get you much closer to the editor of your dreams.

##.vimrc
* [My .vimrc file](https://github.com/theicfire/dotfiles/blob/master/vim/.vimrc) has some pretty great ideas I haven't seen elsewhere.
* This is a minimal vimrc that focuses on three priorities:
    * adding options that are strictly better (like more information showing in autocomplete)
    * more convenient keystrokes (like  `[space]w` for write, instead of `:w [enter]`)
    * a similar workflow to normal text editors (like enabling the mouse)

### Installation
* Copy this to your home directory and restart Vim. Read through it to see what you can now do (like  `[space]w` to save a file)
    * Mac users - making a hidden normal file is suprisingly tricky. Here’s one way:
        * in the command line, go to the home directory
        * type `nano .vimrc`
        * paste in the contents of the .vimrc file
        * `ctrl+x`, `y`, `[enter]` to save
* You should now be able to press  `[space]w` in normal mode to save a file.
* `[space]p` should paste from the system clipboard (outside of Vim).
    * If you can’t paste, it’s probably because Vim was not built with the system clipboard option. To check, run `vim --version` and see if `+clipboard` exists. If it says `-clipboard`, you will not be able to copy from outside of Vim.
    * For Mac users, homebrew install Vim with the clipboard option. Install homebrew and then run `brew install vim`.
        * then move the old Vim binary: `$ mv /usr/bin/vim /usr/bin/vimold`
        * restart your terminal and you should see `vim --version` now with `+clipboard`

##Plugins
* The easiest way to make Vim more powerful is to use Vintageous in Sublime Text (version 3). This gives you Vim mode inside sublime. I suggest this (or a similar setup with the Atom editor) if you aren't a Vim master. Check out [Advanced Vim](advanced.html) if you are.
* Vintageous is great, but I suggest you change a few settings to make it better.
    * Clone [this repository](https://github.com/theicfire/Vintageous) to `~/.config/sublime-text-3/Packages/Vintageous`, or similar. Then check out the "custom" branch.
        * Alternatively, you can get a more updated Vintageous version by cloning [the official](https://github.com/guillermooo/Vintageous) repository and then copying over [this patch](https://github.com/theicfire/Vintageous/commit/19ff6311b01e3ae259b7eb8e3944687b42ba06ff).
    * Change the user settings (`User/Preferences.sublime-settings`) to include:
        * `"caret_style": "solid"`
        * This will make the cursor not blink, like in Vim.
        * Sublime Text might freeze when you do this. It’s a bug; just restart Sublime Text after changing the file.
    * `ctrl+r` in Vim means "redo". But there is a handy Ctrl + R shortcut in Sublime Text that gives an "outline" of a file. I remapped it to alt+r by putting this in the User keymap
        * `{ "keys": ["alt+r"], "command": "show_overlay", "args": {"overlay": "goto", "text": "@"} },`
    * [Add the ability to toggle Vintageous on and off](https://github.com/guillermooo/Vintageous/wiki/Toggling-Vintageous)
    * Mac users: you will not have the ability to hold down a navigation key (like holding j to go down). To fix this, run the commands specified here: [https://gist.github.com/kconragan/2510186](https://gist.github.com/kconragan/2510186)
 
* Now you should be able to restart sublime and have a great vim environment! Sweet Dude.

##Switch Caps Lock and Escape
* I highly recommend you switch the mapping of your caps lock and escape keys. You'll love it, promise! Switching the two keys is platform dependent; Google should get you the answer

##Other
I don’t personally use these yet, but I’ve heard other people do!

* `:wqa` - Write and quit all open tabs (thanks Brian Zick)
